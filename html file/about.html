<p align="center"><font size="5">Smile Foundation was initiated in 2002 when a group of friends came together with the intention of giving back to the society. They were inspired by the thought and philosophy of Peter Senge, the founder of the Society for Organizational Learning who has propagated that “sustainability, social equality and the environment are now business problems…” and corporate leaders can’t expect governments to solve them alone.</font></p>

<font size="5"><p align="center">What triggered these thoughts was the liberalisation of the Indian economy in the 1990’s which brought with it immense opportunities. Business revived, and India became not just a market, but also an investment prospect for the developed world. Disposable incomes and early settlements became a living reality for the working middle-class. For the first time in India, professionals could think beyond making a living, and contribute towards the society.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Fuelled with enthusiasm, Smile’s founders gave a shape to their dream, and Smile Foundation was born. Over the last two decades, Smile has evolved as a sustainable Indian social institution – committed to do real work on the ground, and make the society and businesses inclusive in the process of bringing change.</font>
</p><br>
<p><font size="5">On our way, we had to make many difficult choices and constantly innovate – whether it was choosing to work on the ground through a service-delivery approach, practicing management principles and adopting a business-like approach in the development sector, creating a unique resource modeling keeping businesses at the centre, or promoting the concept of civic driven change. Yes, we almost always took the road less travelled, and as they say, that has made all the difference!<br></font></p>

<td colspan="6">We believe that education is both the means as well as the end to a better life: the means because it empowers an individual to earn his/her livelihood and the end because it increases one’s awareness on a range of issues – from healthcare to appropriate social behaviour to understanding one’s rights – and in the process help him/her evolve as a better citizen. Education is the most effective tool which helps children build a strong foundation; enabling them to free themselves from the vicious cycle of ignorance, poverty and disease.</td>

<p><font size="4">But while working on the ground, we realised that child education cannot be done in isolation, without ensuring the welfare of the whole family. Health is also a part of education. A child will not go to school if he is sick. If a child’s parents are afflicted with health problems, he might drop-out of school and start earning instead. Unless the mother is healthy and empowered, the child cannot be either. It is all interlinked. <br>

Our other programmes evolved as a logical progression to our education programme – be it livelihood, health or women empowerment. Today, children and education continue to remain at the centre of all we do, but through the lifecycle approach we also address the needs of the children’s families and communities.
